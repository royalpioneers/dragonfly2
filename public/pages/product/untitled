chmod +x file.sh

Now your can run your .sh file as follows

./file.sh

Another way to run .sh file in Linux

sh file.sh

OR

bash file.sh

First you might need to give the .sh file permission to execute. chmod +x file.sh, then you can execute it with ./file.sh.

You can also right-click on the file, select Properties, then select Permissions and then select 'Allow executing file as program'. Then you double-click the file and select 'Run in Terminal' or 'Run'.
